# warhammer-quest-expansions
A set of community created expansion content for the Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game. 

This content was created for **private use only** and represents the work of _many content creators_ in the Warhammer community. You can check out [@Drunki's aggregation post](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2202185/fan-made-quests-heroes-and-enemies-legacy-warhamme) for more content I chose not to include here based on my own preferences. I do not plan on maintaining this repository any further than I already have, so feel free to fork it and use it for your personal projects.

Many thanks to all those who contributed and may this repository serve as a useful tool for you all!
